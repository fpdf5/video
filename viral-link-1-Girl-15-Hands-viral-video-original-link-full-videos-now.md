Pakistani TikToker Imsha Rehman has spoken out for the first time about the viral video that “ruined” her life. After the alleged leak, the influencer disappeared from social media and deactivated her accounts. In a recent interview with Nukta Pakistan, Imsha Rehman called the viral video “fake”.

“When I saw the video, it felt like my life was over. I can’t go to university, I can’t face people, and I am receiving a lot of death threats,” the Pakistan TikToker said.
